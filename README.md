# InterviewTest
An organization that needs to send data over the net asked you to write an application that will encrypt it (i.e. the data) so that it should be transferred securely. The data is transmitted as six-digit integers. Your application will read a six-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt it as follows:  Replace each single digit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the new value by 10. Then swap the 1st digit with the 4th, and swap the 2nd digit with the 5th, and 3rd digit with the 6th. Then output the encrypted data.  Write another application that takes an encrypted six-digit number and decrypts it (by reversing the encryption pattern) to form the original number back.
